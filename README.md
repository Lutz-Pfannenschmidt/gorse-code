# Go Morsecode - Gorsecode
It's a simple Morsecode translator. It can translate Morsecode to any language that uses the Latin alphabet.
It's Tree based, so it's very fast and (somewhat) efficient (it rebuilts the tree every execution).

## Usage
```bash
go run .
```
Then you can input morsecode and it will translate it to the Latin alphabet.
